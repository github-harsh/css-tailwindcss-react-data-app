# css-tailwindcss-react-data-app
This is a tailwind css and react app created to showcase how the landing page for a subscription based application might look like. The app has  6 sections each one created as a separate component in react. I have used tailwindcss to style the app and primary purpose of this app is to showcase the use of tailwindcss and its capabilities
